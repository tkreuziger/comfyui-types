# Examples

We are providing some examples to get a better understanding of how to use this
library, when creating your own nodes.

- [Example 1](/examples/example_1.md): Dummy example to show the full definition
of a node.
- [Example 2](/examples/example_2.md): A simple node for logging anything you
want during execution.
- [Example 3](/examples/example_3.md): A real-life example, using the Claude
Vision API to describe images as text.
